            <p>Iceland is about a journey of a soul in the cold and lonely land of Iceland...</p>
            <p> It begins with a song 'Raindrop', very positive one, about love and need of another soul to marge into one. I was very inspiried by Jose Gonzales' 'Teardrop' composing it. </p>
            <p>'Brokenness' is a song I wrote when I was contempleinging about the world we live in and how broken it looks like and how much it affects people, making them broken 
                as well. It ends with a cry for help to God, the only one that can change this brokenness. 
            <p>'Cliff' is the heaviest song I have yet. It contains  
                two solos - one on bass and other one on guitar. I made it around the same time I did 'Do Not Listen II' from 'In the Autumn Forest'. It is about
                a choice we all have - if we wanna waste our lives or make them into something beautiful and meaningful. </p>
            <p>'Volcono' is a song I made very fast and
                didn't really think about publishing it, but my wife changed my mind haha. Lyrics are about lots and lots of things I have (like physical things, but also thoughts)
                that don't really need for anything at all, things that are there just to diturb me. </p>
            <p>'Blackstones' is the wierdest one for me. It finally touches  
                the subject of a journey that this album is. About how this soul end up bruised anyway and how Someone showed up to help it. </p>
            <p>'Word of Mine'
                is another faith-releted one. I wrote it just before engagement when I was put before life-long decision and how the Word of God helped me make it. </p>
            <p>'Natural Beauty' is a really personal one, it certainly is about love. Go listen and make your own explenation for this one :). </p>
            <p>'Going Myslef | Going With You'
                has a grammar mistake even in the name, but who cares (Simon does). It was the first single of the album. It's about how going BY myself and not 
                listening to others (specially God) can really end up in tragic situations (trust me). 
            <p>'Ellidaey' is about mistakes. It's really emotional for me. It my
                favourite one on the composition level. 'Now I understand, I now that I'm weak' and 'Will You carry me?' should explain what it is about. </p>
            <p>'Iceland', the last
                one (or is it?), is the real outro of the album. It is a sum up to the journey and how the soul realised that the Iceland is just a escape from reality.
                It saw that this place is cold and not very safe. It is coming back... </p>
